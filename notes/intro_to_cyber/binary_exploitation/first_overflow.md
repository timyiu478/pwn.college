# Easy

## Description

Overflow a buffer on the stack to set the right conditions to obtain the flag!

# Hard

## Description

This challenge is identical to its "easy" version from a security perspective, but has the following changes:

- Unlike the easy version, it does not give you helpful debug output. You will have to recover this information using a debugger.
- For all other "hard" versions, the source code will not be provided, and you will need to reverse-engineer the binary using your knowledge of the "easy" version as a reference. However, for this one challenge, to get you familiar with the differences between the easy and hard versions, we will provide the source code.
- Some randomization is different. Buffers might have different lengths, offsets might vary, etc. You will need to reverse engineer this information from the binary!
