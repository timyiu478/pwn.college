# Problem

From your host at 10.0.0.1, connect to the remote host at 10.0.0.2 on port 31337, and then shutdown the connection.

Sometimes the other side of a connection wants to wait for you to finish sending all of your data before it finishes sending data back to you. Imagine a protocol where the client might need to send lots of data, over a long duration, before the server can respond with some final result. In this case, it might not make sense to preestablish how much data will be sent in total as part of the protocol, because the client might not know at the beginning how much data it will need to send. How can we handle this situation?

One option would be to have the client send a single packet at the end that just says "END". But network packets can be complicated, with no guarantees from the network that they won't be split apart or merged together. Or what if you want to be able to send "END" as part of the data?

Netcat is a simple tool, that translates data from standard input to network packets and vice versa to standard output. So how do you shutdown the network connection in this way with netcat? You do the equivalent file operation: you close standard input! In an interactive terminal session, you can do this by pressing Ctrl-D.

Unfortunately, netcat may not actually do this by default. Review the man page for netcat (man nc) to see if there is any way to configure netcat to shutdown the network connection after closing standard input (EOF).

# Solution

1. enter

```bash
nc -q 2 10.0.0.2 31337
```

2. send EOF by typing Ctrl-D then type Enter

# Note

The `-q` flag: 

```
       -q seconds
               after  EOF  on  stdin,  wait  the  specified  number of
               seconds and then quit. If  seconds  is  negative,  wait
               forever  (default).   Specifying a non-negative seconds
               implies -N.
```
